			Hello! My name is Moreen and I am a junior at Kyoto University, majoring in civil engineering. After reading
			my resume, some people may wonder, why civil engineering? Well, why not? I wrote my first line of HTML when
			I was in primary school, got into HTML, CSS, and iOS development in secondary school, and to this day, I
			still think of software development as a fun hobby of mine. As for civil engineering, I just think it's cool
			to work on big structures.
		</p>

			In my second year of college, I was lucky enough to land my first software engineering internship. Even
			since then, my passion for software development has grown exponentially. From writing my own code to exploring 
			projects made by others, I try to learn as much as I can every day.
